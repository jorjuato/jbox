# This is a hook for live-helper(7) to install sun-java.
# To enable it, copy or symlink this hook into your config/chroot_local-hooks
# directory.
#
# Note: This hook requires packages from the non-free category. Make sure you
# enabled it in your configuration.

# live-helper sets DEBIAN_FRONTEND to 'noninteractive' to advise debconf to not
# ask any questions while installing packages. Suns redistribution terms for
# Java do not allow this, therefore we need to overwrite DEBIAN_FRONTEND for
# this apt-get call only.

# In case you do accept the license terms, you can also preseed the values
# for a complete non-interactive build, by uncommenting the following three lines:

echo "sun-java6-bin shared/accepted-sun-dlj-v1-1 boolean true" > /root/preseed
debconf-set-selections < /root/preseed
rm -f /root/preseed

DEBIAN_FRONTEND="dialog" apt-get install --yes sun-java6-bin sun-java6-jre sun-java6-plugin
# apt-get remove --yes iceweasel
# Ensure that /tmp has the right permissions; apparently sun-java5-doc tampers
# with it
chmod 1777 /tmp
